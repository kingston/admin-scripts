Administration Script Quickies
==============================

Just a couple scripts I wrote that came in handy here and there.  No
guarantees of anything, but they've been pretty handy for just getting
things up and running.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress so there might not be much here initially**

Any feedback/suggestions are welcome (web _at_ kingstontam.com)

Backup Scripts
--------------
Directory: backup/

### backup.sh
Backs up a directory and SQL database on a weekly and daily basis (configurable)

It will rotate backups so backups beyond a certain week/day will be deleted automatically

Tested on GNU Bash version 3.2.25
